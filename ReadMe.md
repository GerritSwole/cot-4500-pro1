On mac just download the assignment_1.py file adn run in your terminal, all outputs should match the slides save for a minor rounding error in the Newton Method. I also wasn't sure which fixed-point example you wanted us to replicate, so I did both. It does require the math apckage, as mentioned in requirements.txt
